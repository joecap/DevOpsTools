Open Source Tools for Dev Ops

Collaborative approaches to Development Operations and Release Engineering
are becoming the norm as corporations and individuals seek to improve the
time it takes to bring about software inovations.

To this end, we have created this set of tools which are used in primarily
Cloud-based IT operations for the deployment and management of hosts, 
data storage, services, and microservice based operations.

The scripts and procedures primarily rely on the following technologies:
- Ubuntu Linux
- bash as needed
- Node.js and JavaScript - preferred when available
- Amazon Web Services and the JavaScript aws-sdk.
- Ansible
- Docker

We favor Test Driven Development and Pair Programming. Our scripts
include a script for launching and configuring 
a pair programming development platform on AWS

Many additional technologies involved in DevOps will be the focus
of the deployment or configuration scripts.

Why this set of Tools?

The product of IT work is often just a configured host adequate to the operation
of a necessary service and hopefully a sufficiently documented procedure
which is adequate to create that host. However, our experience has
shown great value in creating automated procedures for this purpose:
	1) The systems can be recreated on demand as needed.
	2) The resulting systems are highly likely to be reproducible 
           and thus reliable.
	3) It's much easier to maintain a working program that to try to
	   decypher how a system was originally created.
        4) We are much more likely to create a test system if an automated
           script exists. This decreases or removes the temptation to try
           something new on a production system.

Ultimately, we will have a "DevOps in a Box" set of tools. That is, starting from zero, we can create a complete operation in the AWS cloud service.

By keeping it open and a communinity collaboration, the contributors 
benefit and individuals who use this set of tools are not hampered 
by restrictions on their own creations.

Setup for Node.js and JavaScript

Use npm to install node and other needed packages.
